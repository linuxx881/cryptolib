## LEGAL ACTIONS IN CASE OF SECURITY BREACH

In the event of a security breach, leak, or attack involving this package, the following legal actions may be pursued:

### 1. **Cease and Desist**
If someone is found to be leaking sensitive information or actively attacking this package, we reserve the right to send a **Cease and Desist** letter to the responsible party. The letter will demand the following actions:
- Immediate cessation of any activities that involve the disclosure or exploitation of security vulnerabilities in this package.
- Removal of any publicly disclosed or privately shared sensitive information related to the package.
- Refrain from any further actions that may cause harm to the integrity or security of the package or its users.

A violation of this notice may lead to more serious legal consequences, including the pursuit of legal action.

### 2. **Legal Reporting**
If the actions go beyond simple leaks or attacks and involve illegal activities, such as:
- Unauthorized access to code or systems.
- Financial harm to the project or its users.
- Fraud or malicious intent.

We will report the incident to the relevant legal and cybersecurity authorities.

In the United States, incidents may be reported to:
- **FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3)**
- **Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)**

For international cases, appropriate law enforcement agencies may be contacted, particularly if the incident has cross-border implications.

### 3. **Litigation**
In cases where damages (financial, reputational, or legal) have occurred due to a security breach or attack, we may pursue formal legal action against the responsible parties. This may involve:
- Seeking **damages** for any losses or harm caused to the package, its users, or its developers.
- Filing lawsuits in relevant jurisdictions if the breach has resulted in significant legal or financial harm.

If you are a user, contributor, or affected party, you are encouraged to report such incidents as soon as possible. In extreme cases, we will seek restitution through formal litigation processes.

### 4. **Consultation with Legal Experts**
In all cases where legal action is considered, we will consult with legal professionals specializing in:
- **Intellectual Property (IP) Law**: To understand the legal implications around code ownership and violations.
- **Cybersecurity Law**: To ensure that actions taken comply with relevant cyber laws and regulations.
- **Technology Law**: To address any breach of agreements or violations that may arise from the misuse of this package.
