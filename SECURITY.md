# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively maintain security updates for all versions **except** pre-releases and ones **explicitly** deprecated.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it **responsibly**. Follow these steps:

### 1. Use GitHub Security Advisories

Navigate to the project's **Security Advisories** page to privately disclose the vulnerability.

### 2. Open a Private GitHub Issue

If Security Advisories is unavailable, you can create a **private** GitHub issue. When creating the issue:

- Clearly mark it as "Security" in the title.
- Provide all relevant details, including steps to reproduce and any potential impacts.

### 3. Response Timeline

We will respond to your report within **5 business days** and work on a resolution promptly. You will be updated periodically about the progress.

### If a critical security issue is found and verified, the version(s) linked to it will be taken down until further notice. Users are recommended to download and use different **more** secure versions until then for assurance.

## User Responsibility

It is recommended that all users read this file before installation and usage for proper notice, protection, and protocol. All users should **adhere** to these requirements for cryptographical safety. Those who don't can be considered a **threat** and are a **liability** to the security of this package.

### **Users linked to "leaks" of security issues or attacks may face consequences.**
